# Detectron.jittor
This is a repo converted from maskrcnn-benchmark and added more SOFA models based on jittor

We reimplemented maskrcnn-benchmark and added more SOFA models into it. maskrcnn-benchmark is [here](https://github.com/facebookresearch/maskrcnn-benchmark)

Why not reimplement detectron2?
Because it is based on a lot of additional libs and we want a pure repo.
